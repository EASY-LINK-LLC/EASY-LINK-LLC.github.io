          your account secure.
          <br />
          Acceptable Conduct<br />
          You are responsible for the actions of all users of your account and
          any data that is created, stored, displayed by, or transmitted by your
          account while using Easy Link Server.com. You will not engage in any
          activity that interferes with or disrupts Easy Link Server.com's

          <br />
          Prohibited Usage<br />
          You agree that any of the below activities are considered prohibited
          usage and will result in immediate account suspension or cancellation

          notice. <br />

          Misuse of System Resources: Intentional misuse of system resources,
          including but not limited to employing programs that consume excessive
          network capacity, CPU cycles, or disk IO.<br />
          <br />
          Spam and Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE): Easy Link Server.com has a zero
          tolerance policy on spam, Junk E-mail or UBE. Spam, Junk-mail and UBE
          are defined as: the sending of the same, or substantially similar,
          unsolicited electronic mail messages, whether commercial or not, to
          more than one recipient. A message is considered unsolicited if it is
          posted in violation of a newsgroup charter or if it is sent to a
          recipient who has not requested the message. UBE also includes e-mail
          with forged headers, compromised mail server relays, and false contact
          information. This prohibition extends to the sending of unsolicited
          mass mailings from another service, which in any way implicates the
          use of Easy Link Server.com whether or not the message actually
          originated from our network.
          <br />
          Mailing Lists: Easy Link Server.com's mass mailing rules also apply to
          mailing lists, list servs, or mailing services you may contract with.
          The policy is stated as follows: An acceptable mailing list will be
          focused at a targeted audience that has voluntarily signed up for your
          e-mail information or that has made their e-mail address available for
          distribution of information from you. The list must also allow for
          automatic removal of recipients with non-distribution in the
          future.<br />
          <br />
          Access to Other Computers or Networks without Authorization:
          Attempting unauthorized and/or illegal access of computers, networks
          and/or accounts not belonging to party seeking access. Any act which
          interferes with the services of another user or network. Any act
          relating to the circumvention of security measures.<br />
          <br />
          Easy Link Server and the services it provides may only be used for
          lawful purposes. Transmission, distribution, or storage of any
          information, data or material in violation of United States or state
          regulation or law, or by the common law, is prohibited. This includes,
          but is not limited to, material protected by copyright, trademark,
          trade secret, or other intellectual property rights. Easy Link
          Server.com's services may not be used to facilitate infringement of
          these laws in any way. <br />
          Other Activities viewed as Illegal or Harmful: Engaging in illegal
          activities or engaging in activities harmful to the operations of Easy
          Link Server.com or Easy Link Server.com's customers.<br />
          <br />
          Providing False Data on any Contract or Application: including
          fraudulent use of credit card numbers.<br />
          <br />
          Easy Link Server does not prohibit the use of distributed, peer to
          peer network services such as Tor, nor does Easy Link Server routinely
          monitor the network communications of customer Easy Link Servers as a
          normal business practice. However, customers are responsible for the
          contents of network traffic exiting their Easy Link Server. Any usage
          that prompts the receipt of abuse complaints pertaining to violation
          of United States and/or international copyright law must be promptly
          discontinued to avoid service cancellation for violation of these
          terms.

          You agree that Easy Link Server.com shall be permitted to charge your

          subject to a $5.00 service charge unless cancelling within the 7 day
          money-back guarantee period.
          <br />

          <br />
          Account Cancellation or Suspension<br />
          Easy Link Server.com reserves the right to suspend network access to
          any customer if, in the judgment of the Easy Link Server.com network
          administrators, the customer's server is the source or target of a
          violation of any of the other terms of service or for any other reason
          which Easy Link Server.com chooses. Easy Link Server.com will use
          reasonable care in notifying the Customer and in resolving the problem
          in a method resulting in the least amount of service interference.
          Easy Link Server.com reserves the right to terminate service without
          notice for continued and repeated violations of the terms of service.
          If inappropriate activity is detected, all accounts of the Customer in
          question will be deactivated until an investigation is complete. Prior
          notification to the Customer is not assured. In extreme cases, law
          enforcement will be contacted regarding the activity. The customer
          will not be credited for the time the customer's machines were
          suspended.<br />
          <br />
          If at any time it becomes necessary for Easy Link Server.com to cancel
          a customer's service without cause, Easy Link Server.com will provide
          30 days advance notice.<br />
          <br />
          You may cancel the service at any time by using the "Cancel Account"
          link located on the "My Accounts" sub-tab of the Easy Link Server
          Manager. Accounts are canceled immediately after confirmation.
          Cancellation of service does not relieve Subscriber of responsibility
          for the payment of all accrued charges.<br />
          <br />
          Network<br />
          If Easy Link Server.com assigns Customer an Internet Protocol address
          for Customer's use, the right to use that Internet Protocol address
          shall belong only to Easy Link Server.com, and Customer shall have no
          right to use that Internet Protocol address except as permitted by
          Easy Link Server.com in its sole discretion in connection with the
          Services, during the term of this Agreement. Our allocation of IP
          addresses is limited by ARIN's policies. These policies state that use
          of IP addresses for IP based virtual hosts will not be accepted as
          justification for new IP addresses when the protocol supports
          name-based virtual hosts. What this means to you is that you MUST use
          name-based hosting where possible. Limitation of Liability<br />
          <br />
          Subscriber acknowledges that the service provided is of such a nature
          that service can be interrupted for many reasons other than the
          negligence of Easy Link Server.com and that damages resulting from any
          interruption of service are difficult to ascertain. Therefore,
          subscriber agrees that Easy Link Server.com shall not be liable for

          control of Easy Link Server.com. Subscriber further acknowledges that
          Easy Link Server.com's liability for its own negligence may not in any

          Link Server.com be liable for any special or consequential damages,
          loss or injury. Easy Link Server.com is not responsible for any
